    <<~EOS
      wwk is the CLI and wwkd is the background agent for WellWhaddyaKnow.

      Install agent as login item (starts automatically at login):
        wwk agent install

      Agent management:
        wwk agent status    # Show agent status
        wwk agent start     # Start agent
        wwk agent stop      # Stop agent
        wwk agent uninstall # Remove login item

      Usage:
        wwk status          # Show current status
        wwk today           # Today's summary
        wwk week            # This week's summary
        wwk --help          # Full command reference

      For the menu bar GUI app:
        brew install --cask daylily-informatics/tap/wellwhaddyaknow
    EOS
  end

  test do
    # Test that the CLI runs and shows help
    assert_match "USAGE: wwk", shell_output("#{bin}/wwk --help")
  end
end
